			<h3>PCC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h3>
			<p><span class="important">PPC</span> (<a href="#">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="important">PPC Automation</span> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="#">pay-per-click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your buisness.
				</li>
				<li><span class="important">PPC Management</span> - <a href="#">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a href="#">paid search</a> marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an <a href="#">online ad campaign</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>WordStream's <a href="#">PPC software</a> is specifically designed to aid in these two <a href="#">PPC search engine</a> marketing areas. This page will show you both the processess the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.</p>
