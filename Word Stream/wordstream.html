			<h3>PCC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h3>
			<p><span class="important">PPC</span> (<span class="highlightunder">pay-per click</span>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="important">PPC Automation</span> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <span class="highlightunder">pay-per click advertising</span>>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your buisness.
				</li>
				<li><span class="important">PPC Management</span> - <span class="highlightunder">PPC management</span> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <span class="highlightunder">paid search</span> marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an <span class="highlightunder">online ad campaign</span>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>WordStream's <span class="highlightunder">PPC software</span> is specifically designed to aid in these two <span class="highlightunder">PPC search engine</span> marketing areas. This page will show you both the processess the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.</p>
